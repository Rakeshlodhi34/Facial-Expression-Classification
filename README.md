# üòä Facial Expression Classification using MATLAB

This project implements a **Machine Learning model in MATLAB** for classifying facial expressions into various emotion categories such as **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, etc. It leverages image processing techniques for preprocessing and uses machine learning algorithms to recognize and categorize emotions from facial images.

## üìå Overview
Facial expressions are powerful indicators of human emotion. The objective of this project is to automate facial expression recognition using image processing and machine learning methods in MATLAB.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. **Install MATLAB** with:
   - Image Processing Toolbox
   - Machine Learning Toolbox

2. **Clone or download** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Facial-Expression-Classification.git
Place your dataset inside the data/ directory. Make sure it follows a structured format (e.g., separate folders per expression label).

Open MATLAB and set the working directory to the project folder.

Run the scripts in the following order:

preprocessing.m

feature_extraction.m

model_training.m

model_evaluation.m

Check the results in the results/ directory for metrics and visualizations.

üìä Results
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset, demonstrating its capability in classifying facial expressions across multiple emotion categories. (Replace X% with actual result once available)
