# Facial-Expression-Classification
Facial Expression Classification ML Model using MATLAB
Overview
This project implements a machine learning model in MATLAB for facial expression classification. The goal is to classify facial expressions into different emotion classes, such as happy, sad, angry, etc., using image processing and machine learning techniques.

Technologies Used
MATLAB: Utilized MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox and Machine Learning Toolbox.
Image Processing: Included face detection, alignment, feature extraction, and data augmentation techniques.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Ensemble methods.
Evaluation Metrics: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance evaluation.
Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset for training and testing the model.
code/
preprocessing.m: Script for preprocessing facial images.
feature_extraction.m: Extracts features from preprocessed images.
model_training.m: Trains the machine learning model.
model_evaluation.m: Evaluates the model performance on test data.
results/: Stores the results and evaluation metrics.
README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.
Usage
Install MATLAB and ensure the required toolboxes are available.
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Place your facial expression dataset in the data/ directory.
Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
Run the scripts in the following order:
preprocessing.m
feature_extraction.m
model_training.m
model_evaluation.m
View the results and evaluation metrics in the results/ directory.
Results
The facial expression classification model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing and categorizing different facial expressions.
